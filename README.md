# docker-pgtap

pgTAP - Unit testing for PostgreSQL.

This is a docker image that contains pgTAP.

## About pgTAP

> pgTAP is a suite of database functions that make it easy to write TAP-emitting unit tests in psql scripts or xUnit-style test functions. The TAP output is suitable for harvesting, analysis, and reporting by a TAP harness.

From: [pgTAP: Unit testing for PostgreSQL](http://pgtap.org/)

## Install

This docker image is available as an automated build on [the docker registry hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/hbpmip/pgtap/), so using it is as simple as running:


```console
$ docker run hbpmip/pgtap:1.0.0-2
```

## How to use this image

### Start a postgres instance

```console
$ docker run --name db-under-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```
then fill the database with tables and data, using something you want to test.

### Execute the tests

```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm --name pgtap --link db-under-test:db -e PASSWORD=postgres -v /local/folder/with/tests/:/test hbpmip/pgtap:1.0.0-2
```

Environment variables:

* DATABASE
* HOST=db
* PORT=5432
* USER="postgres"
* PASSWORD=""
* `TESTS="/test/*.sql"`
* VERBOSE=0
* INSTALL=1
* UNINSTALL=1

Command line options:
```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm --name pgtap lsimons/pgtap -H
```

Options include:
* `-v`: verbose
* `-a`: assume pgTap is already installed, do not install
* `-k`: keep pgTap installed after tests, do not uninstall

### Installing/uninstalling pgtap into your database

This is useful mostly during test development.

```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm --name pgtap --link db-under-test:db -e PASSWORD=postgres --entrypoint /install.sh lsimons/pgtap
```

```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm --name pgtap --link db-under-test:db -e PASSWORD=postgres --entrypoint /uninstall.sh lsimons/pgtap
